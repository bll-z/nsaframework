                    'content': "Changing the way we fight crime - The Cambridge International Symposium on Economic Crime 06 Sep 2004 Speech by Philip Robinson, Sector Leader for Financial Crime, FSA The Financial War on Terror and Organised Crime Preliminaries It is a privilege to be a keynote speaker here today. This is an impressive event &ndash; evidence of the growing recognition of the financial dimension in the fight against all types of crime. Theme of the speech The theme of my speech this morning is the work that we all have to do to fight crime in the financial sector and the importance of that fight as we see it. That work has been building momentum. And we have now to push on, finding new - and better - ways of contributing to fighting crime and terrorist finance. And working more effectively with each other and wider stakeholders. What is the FSA's role? I am sure you know that the FSA is the single UK financial regulator, regulating some 11,000 firms now and many thousands more shortly, when our scope increases to include mortgage and general insurance intermediaries. But what is less known is that the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 broke the regulatory mould, in giving us an explicit financial crime objective of reducing the extent to which it is possible for a [regulated firm] to be used for a purpose connected with financial crime. This is one of our four, equally weighted, statutory objectives. So in all we do fighting financial crime looms large. Which puts us in a new and rather different ball game. It gives a new string to our regulator's bow. And makes us part of the national fight against organised crime and terrorist finance. To improve our effectiveness the FSA has created the Financial Crime Sector Leader post. It is my job to ensure that everything the FSA does takes into account the objective of fighting financial crime. The financial crime risks What financial crime risks are we talking about? Various ways of answering that question: By the type of crime &ndash; money laundering, terrorist financing, fraud, market abuse, cybercrime etc. By reference to who's doing the crime &ndash; Can be committed by firms, or by their staff, can be committed against the firm including by its customers, or the firm itself can be used by third parties, perhaps by facilitating transactions with a criminal purpose. Or by where the criminal is doing the deed: within the UK, or - as is increasingly the case &ndash; internationally. If you're a criminal, moving yourself and your money around the world is a good way of avoiding being caught and punished. Or finally, by how the crime relates to other crime. The laundering of proceeds is what makes the underlying crime &ndash; drug trafficking etc. - profitable. And fraud is often the crime of choice of the organised criminal and the terrorist, because it can be easy money. Developing our role Those then are the crimes &ndash; what do we do about them? Some of what we do remains as it always has been: Raising firms' standards of systems and controls and risk management for financial crime, through our day to day relations with the businesses we regulate. With Rules in our Handbook; and with the sanctions there if need be - taking action, public enforcement action if we have to, if firms' systems and practices are poor. What we call &quot;Policing the perimeter&quot; of our industry &ndash; putting out of business the fraudsters who remain outside the regulatory net but take deposits or market get rich quick investment schemes. Vetting new entrants to the industry and checking that the owners, senior management and other holders of key positions in financial businesses are &quot;fit and proper&quot;. And all of these functions have an impact on crime. Take the Money Laundering Regulations, for example. Before we focussed on defences against money laundering, many firms' procedures were woeful. Our interest has meant that customer identification and monitoring procedures, for example, have become far more rigorous, although perhaps they remain too bureaucratic. As to the situation internationally, we receive many more requests from regulators and law enforcement overseas than we did in the past. And at the same time relationships between the UK and other jurisdictions have grown closer: in two ways formally in the Memoranda of Understanding with individual countries and through the EU and the International Organisation of Securities Commissions &ndash; IOSCO; but also - crucially - in good personal relationships with our partners overseas. National boundaries are no longer the obstacle they once were in the fight against crime and so we must use our time in Cambridge not just to talk to the people we feel we already know but use it to build new collaborations. It is what we do together to fight real crime that makes the difference, it is not enough to have world class Laws. But, building on these firm foundations, we are developing a much richer conception of our role &ndash; a 21st century approach for a world in which there is, quite rightly, a growing emphasis internationally on tackling financial crime. We have much more to bring to the party: We can help strengthen industry's defences against crime. Good law on financial crime is crucial (and we hope that the Home Office find Parliamentary time to reform the law on fraud), but alongside it we need robust, risk-based, effective practices in industry, built on a good understanding of the real world risks. We can encourage firms to do things because that is the best way of managing financial crime risks (and therefore reduce crime), rather than to meet perceived compliance requirements or to defend against regulatory fines. We are a rich source of intelligence that we must share effectively. o And we can work with our partners to disrupt crime. We have some good disruption tools for example, which we need to use boldly &ndash; off our own bat or where partner agencies invite us to do so. o This then is our new approach, a more pro-active way of fighting crime. And, through that, we can understand better the management of the financial crime risks. This new approach underpins a number of our current initiatives: Our review of customer identification procedures, where we are working with stakeholders to design a better way of checking that people are who they claim to be. We are helping produce a system that is better for law enforcement but imposes less pain on the industry and the consumer. We are making ourselves 'easier to do business with' for our intelligence partners by introducing new working procedures. These take account of good practice elsewhere, such as the National Intelligence Model that is now the &quot;industry standard&quot; in UK law enforcement and intelligence circles. As part of this shift we will make our intelligence requirements clearly known to our law enforcement and intelligence partners. We need quality intelligence on financial crime so this can help us focus our efforts, and we have been working with law enforcement on cases where systems and controls in institutions may have broken down. We are not on a witch hunt, although we will not shirk from enforcement activity in those cases that warrant it. We are working with partners to identify how fraud and money laundering are being committed through our regulated firms and how, for example, corrupt insiders have been placed or identified in institutions. We are looking into specific intelligence leads. And we will play our full part in helping law enforcement through intelligence sharing. We will shortly be announcing where we are going over fraud - calling for better systems and controls in the financial sector to manage fraud risks. With these systems and controls being proportionate and effective. But we must be realistic about our ability to fight financial crime But fighting financial crime is very difficult. Money launderers are imaginative, international finance is complex, terrorist finance transactions can look just like ordinary customer behaviour (if the money is going through the formal banking system at all that is). We need to make life harder for the criminal, but let us be under no illusions that we are going to stamp out financial crime. We believe that we at the FSA are fighting the battle more effectively than we did before, and we are looking to build on this. But even if we could bring about flawless customer identification and transaction monitoring systems and suspicious activity reporting that produced fantastic intelligence on crime, that would not be enough. After all it is not suspicious to pay rent, buy food, rent cars. What is really suspicious about what terrorists do can be seen in only a few really unusual transactions that present higher risk so we must provide targeted information to the Financial Industry. We also need to look for the funding of the wider support systems that provide terrorism with logistics and propaganda. In some ways terrorist finance is reverse money laundering with good money being used for evil purposes. The realistic objective is to make life more difficult, more risky, more costly for the criminal or terrorist seeking to use the financial system. What more do we need to do to help deliver on that? Collaboration Collaboration has to be part of the answer&ndash; and I'm glad to say collaboration is already the hallmark of much we do. Some of our closest partners are speaking this morning &ndash; James Hart, from the City of London Police, and Lucy Makinson from the Treasury. We have also heard Sir David Omand speaking about one of our future partners &ndash; the Serious and Organised Crime Agency with its remit over financial crime and money laundering. Customs, the intelligence bodies, the Inland Revenue, they are all close allies. But we can all collaborate more effectively. To help make this happen we all need to understand fully our partners' needs and capabilities, and what we need to tell each other, when. Indeed that collaboration needs to be seamlessly cross border since that is how international crime and terror operates. The FSA must ensure that we are good team players &ndash; whether it be in the operational or intelligence field &ndash; and that we engage with our partners wherever we should. And the opposite applies &ndash; law enforcement, the intelligence bodies, all those working on financial crime, need a good grasp of what we can bring to the party and to be willing to send us the invitations. So a good mutual understanding and willingness to co-operate is crucial. But so is having adequate capacity to respond to the crimes. And here the Government is the key to success. Over money laundering, the Government has set the high level priorities and worked with us to help deliver an effective regime. But the approach over money laundering has to be end-to-end. It is no use firms investing heavily in spotting criminality and filing reports - with the FSA on their backs if their systems aren't up to scratch - if at the end of the day the police don't have the staff to investigate the crimes. Similarly, we will shortly be asking our firms to manage their fraud risks better, but the numbers in police fraud squads have fallen dramatically in recent years. The long and the short of it is that financial crime needs to be a higher priority in the objectives that the Government sets over crime and in the resources it provides to law enforcement. Conclusions So let me draw the threads together. We must all continue to develop a richer conception of our role in relation to financial crime, finding innovative ways to help tackle crime. We can never stamp out financial crime, but we can make it more difficult for the criminal wanting to operate in our sector. Collaboration &ndash; national and international - has to be key, underpinned by a good understanding of each others' needs and capabilities. We can make a difference by helping turn Government's high-level objectives on financial crime into practices on the ground that are proportionate and effective. Law enforcement need more resources to tackle money laundering and fraud. What has our new approach achieved? We've certainly made life more difficult for the money launderer, and we are intending to do the same over the fraudsters operating in our patch. And we are working ever closer with our partners, nationally and internationally. So far so good, and plenty still to come. But I will leave us all with one key question which we must answer. How do we demonstrate to all of the innocent consumers in our societies that our efforts are being successful after all they are the people we are protecting, whose funds we are spending and whose lives we are, in some ways making more difficult to achieve the aims of reducing financial crime. So I offer you then the FSA's new approach to fighting crime &ndash; a practical, risk-based approach, focused on achieving real world results. And a commitment that we stand ready to work with all of you to achieve these results.",

For example, Meritor Investments, Trust MT-4964, and Redwing Holdings were offshore entities controlled by Mr. Pinochet&#039;s son Marco Antonio Pinochet Hiriart and his daughter Ines Lucia Pinochet. These corporations, which handled millions of dollars, held accounts with Citigroup and were maintained at various times from 1981-2005. Pinochet also used twenty-four U.S. accounts and Certificates of Deposit at Banco de Chile-United States from 1995-2004, including six in the name of off-shore corporations controlled by Oscar Custodio Aitken Lavanchy, a Chilean attorney with ties to Mr. Pinochet. Coutts &Co (USA) International, beginning in 1993, opened multiple accounts for offshore corporations controlled by Mr. Aitken. The six offshore corporations were Abanda Finance, Belview International, Sociedad de Inversiones Belview, Eastview Finance, G.L.P. Ltd., and Tasker Investments Ltd. These offshore corporations received deposits totaling over $7 million dollars, including $6 million which had been transferred from Riggs Bank and $1.1 million transferred from accounts in Chile. Furthermore, Mr. Pinochet opened six accounts and Certificates of Deposit at Espirito Santo Bank in Florida,. Some of these accounts were opened in the name of the Trilateral International Trading Ltd, an offshore corporation controlled by Mr. Pinochet and an offshore trust controlled by Mr. Pinochet called the Santa Lucia Trust. These six accounts received deposits of about $3.9 million during an eight-year period. Mr. Pinochet and family members were also found to have used a vast number of offshore accounts located in Argentina, the Bahamas, Cayman Islands, Chile, Gibraltar, Spain, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. Riggs Bank also established two offshore shell corporations in the Bahamas -- Ashburton and Althorp -- and then opened accounts in the names of those shell corporations in the United States and the United Kingdom for Mr. Pinochet and his family&#039;s benefit.

He has been closely linked with al-Qa'ida operatives and involved in plans for conducting hijacking/terrorist operations. Jdey is an associate of Tunisian terror suspect Faker Boussora, and the two may have traveled together in the past. Jdey left his native Tunisia in 1991 and immigrated to Canada, becoming a Canadian citizen in 1995. While in Canada, Jdey studied biology at the University of Montreal and attended the Assunna Mosque in Montreal. Jdey departed Canada in 1999 and received combat training and experience in Afghanistan through 2000. He engaged in fighting against the Afghan Northern Alliance and authored a suicide letter stating his intention to become a martyr for jihad. During this time, Jdey also appeared in a well-known martyrdom video that was later found in an al-Qa'ida leader's house in 2001. Following a return to the Montreal area in 2001 in which Jdey consorted with extremists on methods of joining the jihad, Jdey left Canada. Authorities remain concerned that Jdey may attempt to return to Canada or the United States to plan or participate in a terrorist attack.

Wanted Radullan Sahiron is a senior leader of the Philippines-based Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG). The group split from the much larger Moro National Liberation Front in the early 1990s under the leadership of Abdurajak Abubakar Janjalani, who was killed in a clash with Philippine police in December 1998. Abdurajak Janjalani's younger brother, Khadafi Janjalani, replaced him as the nominal leader of the group. In September 2006, Khadafi Janjalani was killed in a gun battle with the Armed Forces of the Philippines. Radullan Sahiron is assumed to be the new ASG leader. Many innocent men, women, and children have died or have been seriously injured as a result of Sahiron's actions. Sahiron played a role in the May 2001 Dos Palmas kidnapping of three US citizens, including Martin and Gracia Burnham, and 17 Filipinos from a tourist resort in Palawan, Philippines. Several of the hostages, including US citizen Guillermo Sobero, were murdered. Sahiron is believed to be hiding in southern Mindanao where he continues to plot terror schemes that have an impact on many communities. Because of his leadership position within the ASG, whose terrorist attacks have resulted in the deaths of US and Filipino citizens, US authorities consider Sahiron to be a threat to US and Filipino citizens and interests. Sahiron lost his right hand fighting security forces in the 1970s. He is fluent in Arabic and Tausug.

                    'content': "Crime in the Financial Markets Related information Read further information on Financial Crime The financial crime sector 05 Sep 2007 Speech by Philip Robinson, Financial Crime & Intelligence Division Director Keynote Address at the 2007 Cambridge Symposium I would like to start by thanking Professor Barry Rider and the organising committee for inviting me today. To those of us involved in the fight against economic and financial crime, the symposium offers a unique opportunity to catch up with old friends, meet new colleagues as well as sharing our thoughts and experiences. I am delighted to have been asked to speak at this event, and since I now talk to you as the Director of the FSA's newly created Financial Crime and Intelligence Division, perhaps I can talk about the recently established financial crime related outcomes the FSA is trying to achieve in the UK financial markets. It is important first to set the context - although the FSA is the regulator for the UK financial services industry, that does not mean that our efforts to the protect the UK financial system are restricted to the UK &ndash; after all, the UK is one of the world's leading financial centres, financial crime is often international in its reach and criminals do not respect international borders. So it is by working with the broader international framework of standard setters, regulators and law enforcement agencies to extend the risk-based approach, and effectively share intelligence, nationally and internationally , that we hope to make a real difference in the fight against financial crime. The FSA's has a statutory objective to reduce financial crime, one of 4 statutory objectives given to us by Parliament. It complements the 3 other financial sector objectives, namely maintaining market confidence, protecting consumers, and increasing public understanding. And I will return to our objective to maintain market confidence in a few moments. The financial crime objective has a very broad scope. It encompasses not only fraud and money-laundering (which includes terrorist finance) but also market misconduct and other crimes such as corruption and contravention of UN, EU and UK sanctions. The legislation places the focus of our financial crime objective firmly on firms&rsquo; risk management, systems & controls, so that: regulated persons need to be aware of the risk of their business being used in connection with financial crime; regulated persons should take appropriate measures (in relation to their administration and employment practices, the conduct of transactions by them and otherwise) to prevent financial crime, facilitate its detection and monitor its incidence; and regulated persons should devote adequate resources to addressing the financial crime risks they face. But our powers and duties as a regulator do not stop there. We notably also have powers to: prosecute breaches of the Money-Laundering Regulations; co-operate with others on prevention & detection of crime make suspicious activity reports to SOCA. FSA&rsquo;s Financial Crime Outcomes The FSA's Financial Crime and Intelligence Division was created at the beginning of 2007 to increase FSA's effectiveness in tackling Financial Crime. My new division brings together the financial crime expertise that had previously been distributed around the FSA in order to sharpen our focus and increase the speed with which we act. We provide the specialist leadership, tools and expertise the FSA increasingly needs to achieve the outcome of reducing crime in the financial markets. I want to show you something of the FSA wide thinking we have been doing to ensure we raise our game: The six outcomes we believe it is necessary to achieve, how we organise ourselves to improve our capability to achieve them and a glimpse at our current key priorities. We have in fact six financial crime outcomes that we assess we need to achieve in order to successfully reduce crime in the financial markets: FSA is satisfied that persons of questionable integrity do not manage, own or control firms operating in the UK Financial Sector Firms in the UK financial sector act proportionately to prevent financial crime - fewer commit financial crime themselves and firms manage the risk of being used by others to do so with appropriate skill and care Consumers are better equipped to protect themselves from financial crime The international and UK financial crime policy frameworks are more risk-based and proportionate, and FSA delivers what is required of it within those frameworks FSA&rsquo;s Financial Crime risk mitigation is increasingly effective, economic and efficient FSA co-operates effectively with the right partners, both domestically and internationally , to achieve these outcomes Market Confidence and Market Abuse As well as these financial crime intended outcomes, combating market abuse is one of the FSA's top priorities. It is important that the financial services industry should play its part in this work - combating market abuse should not be seen as a job for the regulator alone. So we place a lot of emphasis on working in partnership with the industry, including the Recognised Investment Exchanges. This means we expect that firms should have strong anti-market abuse systems and controls. For example, we published earlier this year findings on best practice for systems and controls for dealing with inside information about mergers and acquisitions. It also means that we expect firms to inform us of suspicious transactions by their clients in the same way that we would expect them to notify us of fraud or misconduct. Working in concert under the new Financial Crime and Intelligence Division For the FSA to achieve our financial crime and market confidence objectives a number of different areas of FSA have to work in collaboration. Our Authorisation, and Change in Control and Passporting teams play the crucial role of gatekeepers, aiming to keep the criminals out of the market. Our Markets and Supervision teams have crucial roles to play in overseeing those who are subject to our regulation and in carrying out surveillance. We are currently making a major investment in our IT systems to increase our capabilities to identify potential cases of market abuse. And our Enforcement Division has powers to bring both civil and criminal cases &ndash; the FSA is one of the very few financial regulators who have this dual role. Within our new Financial Crime and Intelligence Division, we have an operations team, significantly increasing our capacity to undertake more thematic and case work on financial crime issues. So if firms and law enforcement alert us of an urgent matter, we will be able to tackle the problem more rapidly than we have in the past. I want to emphasise that our structure does not put all responsibilities for fighting financial crime in the hands of my new division. The tables I have shown here lay out which areas of FSA have the lead accountability for achieving our financial crime outcomes. Our new Financial Crime and Intelligence division provides specialist tools and expertise to assist those lead areas. But what all of us in my division have to do it provide leadership of FSA's efforts. Our experience is that supervisory, policy and enforcement colleagues are experts in Prudential and Conduct of Business matters, but not always in financial crime. Perhaps we see a new Supervisory approach developing; Integrity supervision. If Conduct of Business supervision asks the question &quot;Do honest firms treat customers fairly?&quot; and Prudential supervision asks the question &quot;Do honest firms have enough capital and controls?&quot;. Then Integrity supervision has perhaps to ask the question &quot;Are they honest firm acting honestly?&quot;. The Dutch Central Bank has led the way in this area. 'Measuring' financial crime We have heard a lot about measurement in the last couple of days. Whatever you measure you change. Measuring the degree of financial crime is, as you are all aware, no easy task. For market abuse, where we are in the lead, we have published a methodology for measuring &quot;market cleanliness&quot;. This looks at the extent to which share prices move ahead of significant announcements that firms are required to make to the market and, in particular, announcements of mergers or takeover bids. Our analysis indicates that the UK equity market has become significantly cleaner as regards routine announcements. However, the level of informed price movements ahead of takeover announcements remains too high for comfort &ndash; although I must stress that we think we are not the only market that is affected in this way. In other areas, various agencies do measure financial crime; but the results are patchy, as has been shown by the recent work led by Professor Levi for the Association of Chief Police Officers. We therefore fully support the main recommendations of the UK Government's Fraud Review, and notably the creation of the National Fraud Strategic Authority (NFSA) as well as the National Fraud Reporting Centre. I always like to excite the academics who come to the Symposium. Academic work in this area is essential. An experienced economist recently said to me that &quot;financial crime policy in an evidence free zone&quot;. Following my attendance at the Terror Finance workshop yesterday I am sure Bill Thompson would agree with him. To address this deficit, the FSA is itself launching a further long term research project this autumn to measure the scale and impact of crime in the UK financial sector, with the aim of improving our own understanding of the extent of financial sector abuse, as well as its wider effects on society at large. And we are just commencing the process of selecting the academic team to carry this out. So as I close, let me spell out some of the main risks to achieving our financial crime outcomes that we see today. Risks to achieving our financial crime objective Poor information security currently stands as the highest scored risk on our own risk dashboard. Our Financial Crime Operations team has been dealing with an increasing number of significant personal and corporate data loss cases &ndash; more than 30 since the start of 2007, and these were without exception due to poor Information Security controls in firms. We all know that personal data is increasingly being exploited by criminals, helped by a new market where compromised customer data is bought and sold, affecting not only the affected customers and firms, but public confidence in transacting online. We have recently started a major piece of thematic work looking at firms' controls around personal customer data. An increasing area of concern for FSA is that persons of questionable integrity enter the UK financial market. These people can enter our markets via legitimate channels of Authorisation, Change in Control, Passporting & Listings. Recently we have seen (and successfully prevented) a number of attempts by international criminals to take control of UK financial institutions. The financial markets are global and as the UK is an international financial centre, we must continue to remain vigilant. In Europe, in particular, the single market framework means that a firm authorised in one member state can operate without further vetting in any other member state. So in Europe, and elsewhere we increasingly rely on effective collaboration and information sharing with other regulators to fulfil our financial crime outcomes. My colleague, Justine Walker, will be talking about this in more detail later in the day. Making the risk-based approach an international attribute The sharing of intelligence should go hand in hand with the adoption of a risk-based approach internationally: the more widespread the risk-based approach is globally, the more we will see the need to work together to diminish common counterparty threats, and fight risks in a coordinated and effective way. But obviously the risk-based approach that we advocate so strongly in the UK must be proportionate to the threat considered. A country with weak anti-money laundering processes may pose a very limited threat to the global financial system. So we should look at where the real vulnerabilities are, and not only focus on places where the systems are badly designed, if we want to combat financial crime where it matters the most.

US and Indonesian officials stated that Zulkarnaen became operations chief for Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) after the arrest of his alleged predecessor Riduan Isamuddin, also known as Hambali, in Thailand. Zulkarnaen is described by those who know him as a small man of few words. Zulkarnaen has been identified as possibly the highest ranking leader of JI. He is believed to head the elite squad that helped carry out the suicide bombing at Jakarta's Marriott Hotel that killed 12 people in 2003 and helped to prepare the bombs that killed 202 people in Bali in 2002. Zulkarnaen is one of al-Qa'ida's point men in Southeast Asia and is one of the few people in Indonesia who have direct contact with the al-Qa'ida terror network. Zulkarnaen earned a degree in biology from an Indonesian university, and in the 1980s he was among the first Indonesian militants to go to Afghanistan for training to become an expert in sabotage. Zulkarnaen now leads a squad of militants called Laskar Khos, or 'special force,' whose members were recruited from some 300 Indonesians who trained in Afghanistan and the Philippines. Zulkarnaen was a prot&eacute;g&eacute; of Abdullah Sungkar, founder of JI and the Islamic boarding school al-Mukmin, where Zulkarnaen and other senior militants studied. In the mid-1980s, Sungkar sent a small group of Indonesians to Afghanistan to train in a camp led by mujahidin commander Abdul Rasul Sayyaf. Before Sungkar's death in 1999, Zulkarnaen was often seen by his mentor's side, helping to organize conferences and arrange the agenda of the elder radical. Zulkarnaen is believed to have helped organize fighting in the Maluku islands in the 1990s, and organized a meeting among militants who trained in Afghanistan at different times, enabling them to join forces.

                    'content': "Al-Shabaab (Also known as: Al-Shabaab Al-Islaam, Al-Shabaab al-Islamiya, Al-Shabaab Al-Jihaad, Al-Shabab, Ash-shabaab, Harakat al-Shabaab al-Mujahideen, Harakat Shabab Al-Mujahidin, Harakatul Shabaab al-Mujaahidiin, Hizbul Shabaab, Hisb'ul Shabaab, HSM, Mujahideen Youth Movement, Mujahidin Al-Shabaab Movement, Mujaahidiin Youth Movement, Mujahidin Youth Movement, Shabaab, MYM, The Popular Resistance Movement in the Land of the Two Migrations, The Unity of Islamic Youth, The Youth, Young Mujahideen Movement, Young Mujahideen Movement in Somalia, Youth Wing) The following information is based on publicly available details about al-Shabaab. To the Australian Government's knowledge, these details are accurate and reliable and have been corroborated by classified information. Basis for listing a terrorist organisation Division 102 of the Criminal Code provides that for an organisation to be listed as a terrorist organisation, the Attorney-General must be satisfied on reasonable grounds that the organisation: is directly or indirectly engaged in, preparing, planning, or assisting in or fostering the doing of a terrorist act (whether or not a terrorist act has occurred or will occur); or advocates the doing of a terrorist act (whether or not a terrorist act has occurred or will occur). Details of the organisation Al-Shabaab, or 'the youth', is the name generally applied to the Somali militant group which was formerly the most prominent of the militia groups comprising the militant wing of the Council of Islamic Courts (CIC). The Somali Transitional Federal Government (TFG) and Ethiopian forces ousted the CIC in December 2006. The TFG has governed Somalia since the withdrawal of Ethiopian forces in January 2009 and in June 2011 unilaterally extended its mandate to govern until August 2012 when elections are scheduled. Objectives Al-Shabaab's objective is the establishment of an Islamic state in Somalia, based on Islamic law and the elimination of foreign 'infidel' influence. In pursuance of this objective, al-Shabaab has conducted a violent insurgency against the TFG, and foreign forces supporting the TFG. Al-Shabaab seeks the creation of an 'Islamic Emirate of Somalia', to include Somalia, Somaliland, Puntland, north-eastern Kenya, the Ogaden region of Ethiopia and Djibouti. Leadership and membership Al-Shabaab has an increasingly loose leadership structure with a number of regional factions and commanders. Factional disputes have been reported between al-Shabaab's senior commanders over strategy and ideology. Omar Hammami, a senior foreign fighter, released a video on the weekend of 17 March 2012 stating he felt his \"life may be endangered by Harakat Al-Shabaab Al Mujahadeen due to some differences that occurred between us regarding matters of Shariah and matters of strategy\". Spokesman Sheikh Mukhtar Robow, aka Abu Mansur, was replaced by Sheikh Ali Muhammad Rage in May 2009. Al-Shabaab encompasses a number of elements, ranging from those focused solely on the domestic insurgency in Somalia to elements that support al-Qa'ida's global jihadist ideology. Estimates of al-Shabaab fighters vary from 3 000 to as high as 7 000, with most members being ethnic Somalis. Al-Shabaab has long recruited members from Kenya. However, a small number of al-Shabaab fighters are from other countries including the US and Canada. Since the January 2009 Ethiopian withdrawal, al-Shabaab has established itself as the pre-eminent terrorist actor in Somalia and demonstrated its intent and capability to conduct terrorist attacks within and outside Somalia. On 11 July 2010 al-Shabaab conducted a mass casualty coordinated suicide bomb attack in Uganda's capital Kampala, killing 76 people. On 4 October 2011 more than 100 civilians were killed when an al-Shabaab suicide bomber attacked a government building in Mogadishu. Al-Shabaab has continued its violent insurgency against TFG, Ethiopian and more recently, Kenyan forces inside Somalia and the border regions of Kenya. It has also carried out attacks against peacekeeping forces from Uganda and Burundi, who are in Somalia under the aegis of the AMISOM. The group's senior leadership has said al-Shabaab will continue to fight foreign forces in Somalia, and the TFG. Although al-Shabaab suffered personnel and territorial losses to African Union (AU) mission in Somalia (AMISOM) forces in the first six months of 2011, the group continues to present an enduring threat to East Africa-and to AMISOM and the TFG in particular. Al-Shabaab's propaganda has also continued to develop, with the group's media campaign increasing in sophistication, including starting a Twitter account and continuing to spread its message through Radio al-Analus. Terrorist activity of the organisation Directly or indirectly engaged in the doing of terrorist acts; and directly or indirectly preparing and/or planning terrorist acts Al-Shabaab has prepared, planned and conducted frequent attacks since the beginning of 2007 against Ethiopian and TFG forces using mortar attacks, rocket-propelled grenades and firearms in these attacks. During 2007, elements of al-Shabaab adopted tactics used by Islamist militants in Afghanistan and Iraq including the employment of vehicle-borne improvised explosive devices (VBIEDs), roadside bombs, suicide attacks and beheadings. Suicide-vehicle bombings in October 2008 in Hargeysa and Boosaaso, northern Somalia, were also widely attributed to al-Shabaab. Al-Shabaab claims of attacks sometimes appear in internet statements in the name of the Young Mujahideen Movement in Somalia (YMMS), an al-Shabaab alias. There have been numerous statements claiming attacks including attempted assassinations of TFG officials, and against TFG security forces and Ethiopian forces in Mogadishu and surrounding areas. Significant attacks for which responsibility has been claimed by or reliably attributed to al-Shabaab, include: 29 October 2011: at least three AMISOM peacekeepers were killed and an unknown number of others wounded when two al-Shabaab suicide bombers, including a United States (US) national, detonated explosives at an AMISOM base in the Warshadaha Road area of Mogadishu. 4 October 2011: more than 100 civilians were killed and dozens wounded when an al-Shabaab militant detonated a suicide VBIED targeting a building housing several government ministries in the K4 area of Mogadishu. Al-Shabaab spokesman Ali Muhammad Rage subsequently claimed responsibility for the attack and stated: \"We are promising that attacks against the enemy will be routine, more in number, and will increase day by day\". 1 October 2011: French national Marie Dedieu, was kidnapped by suspected al-Shabaab militants from the island of Manda in Kenya's Lamu Archipelago, near the Somalia border was and then taken to Somalia. In mid-October, French intelligence and Ministry of Foreign Affairs officials announced she had died in captivity in Somalia, likely due to illness. 10 June 2011: TFG Minister of the Interior, Abdishakur Sheikh Hassan, was killed in Mogadishu when a female al-Shabaab suicide bomber detonated her explosive vest inside his residence. 9 September 2010: at least 14 people-including at least five militants-were killed during a sophisticated multi-mode attack on Mogadishu airport utilising VBIEDs, suicide vests and small arms. Among the victims were four Somali police officers, two Ugandan peacekeepers, and three civilians. An al-Shabaab statement the following day claimed the attack had targeted a high-level meeting of UN, AU and Somali representatives. 24 August 2010: two al-Shabaab suicide bombers dressed in army uniforms carried out a small-arms assault on the Muna Hotel near the Presidential Palace in Mogadishu, before detonating their devices. A total of 31 people were reportedly killed, including six members of parliament and five TFG security personnel. 11 July 2010: al-Shabaab carried out a co-ordinated twin suicide bomb attack in the Ugandan capital Kampala. A total of 76 people were killed when the devices were detonated at a rugby club and an Ethiopian restaurant, both of which were crowded with people watching the FIFA World Cup final. 2 January 2010: an al-Shabaab-linked individual attempted to kill Danish cartoonist Kurt Westergaard at his home in Denmark in retaliation to publication of cartoons of the Prophet Mohamed. Westergaard was not hurt and the assailant was shot, wounded, and arrested. 3 December 2009: an al-Shabaab suicide bomber killed 21 people-including four TFG ministers-in an attack on a medical school graduation ceremony being held at the Shamo Hotel in Mogadishu. 17 September 2009: 21 people-including 17 AMISOM peacekeepers-were killed and 40 others injured when al-Shabaab militants detonated two SVBIEDs at the AMISOM headquarters in Mogadishu.The deputy commander of the base was among those killed and the base commander was injured. Advocating the doing of terrorist acts Al-Shabaab members have publicly advocated terrorist attacks in order to further the group's objectives: On 29 December 2011 an al-Shabaab spokesperson vowed that the terror group would launch retaliatory attacks in Kenya if authorities did not withdraw troops from Somalia. \"Kenya has peace, its cities have tall buildings and business is flourishing there. If your government ignores our calls to stop its aggression on Somali soil, we will strike at the heart of your interests\". On 16 November 2011 Sheikh Ali Mohamud Rage warned \"We are telling Kenya that they still have the opportunity to back away from the hellfire it was dragged into and leave our soil, otherwise they will continue suffering\". Abdisalam Ali-an al-Shabaab suicide bomber-published a martyrdom video prior to killing himself on 29 October 2011 in Mogadishu stating \"my brothers and sisters, do Jihad in America, do Jihad in Canada, do Jihad in England [and] anywhere in Europe, in Asia, in Africa, in China, in Australia - anywhere you find kuffar [infidels]. Fight them and be firm against them\". Conclusion On the basis of the above information, ASIO assesses al-Shabaab continues to directly and/or indirectly engage in conducting, preparing, planning, assisting, advocating or fostering the doing of terrorist acts involving threats to human life and serious damage to property. This assessment is corroborated by information provided by reliable and credible intelligence sources. In the course of pursuing its objectives, al-Shabaab is known to have committed or threatened action: with the intention of advancing al-Shabaab's political, religious or ideological causes; that causes, or could cause, serious damage to property, the death of persons or endanger a person's life; and with the intention of creating a serious risk to the safety of sections of the public globally. Other relevant information Links with other groups Al-Shabaab primarily is linked to al-Qa'ida through leadership contacts and training. While al-Shabaab likely still largely operates independently, al-Qa'ida senior leadership previously has endorsed some al-Shabaab activities. On 9 February 2012 a public statement by al-Shabaab leader Mukhtar Abu al-Zubair included a pledge of allegiance to al-Qa'ida and in a reciprocal message al-Qa'ida leader Ayman al-Zawahiri announced that al-Shabaab had joined al-Qa'ida. Links to Australia In late 2011 al-Shabaab-linked Australian citizens Saney Edow Aweys and Nayef El Sayed were convicted of conspiring to plan a terrorist attack in Australia. Aweys was also convicted of aiding and abetting another person to engage in hostile activities in Somalia under s6 of the Commonwealth Crimes (Foreign Incursions and Recruitment) Act 1978 in December 2010. Australian citizen Hussein Hashi Farah was also implicated in terrorist activity associated with al-Shabaab. Level of participation in peace negotiations/political dialogue Al-Shabaab does not participate in the Somali political system, despite AMISOM appeals to the group to lay down their arms and join the Somali peace process. Other designations The group was listed as a proscribed terrorist organisation by the governments of the United States in March 2008, New Zealand in February 2010, Canada in March 2010, the United Kingdom in May 2010, and by the European Union in April 2010. Al-Shabaab is also included in the DFAT Consolidated List that refers to United Nations Security Council Resolution 1373 and in the Consolidated List UN751(Somalia and Eritria).",

For the Catena Aurea of St. Thomas Aquinas, see Works by Thomas Aquinas#Exegetical, homiletical, and liturgical writings. An excerpt from \"The Golden Chain\" The \"Golden Chain\" is a list of purported sponsors of Al Qaeda that was seized in March 2002 in a raid by Bosnian police of the premises of the Benevolence International Foundation in Sarajevo. The list includes at least 20 top Saudi and Gulf States financial sponsors including bankers, businessmen, and former ministers. Part of the list includes a computer file titled \"Tarekh Osama\" or \"Osama History\", but the appellation \"Golden Chain\" itself is due to al Qaeda defector Jamal al-Fadl, who vouched for its authenticity. Most accounts are vague on what year the Golden Chain document was written; some say 1988. but US government counterterrorism advisor Richard Clarke says it dates from 1989. The \"Golden Chain\" was presented by the United States Government in the criminal case United States v. Arnaout filed on January 29, 2003 and in other legal filings, which would cause its veracity and meaning to be brought under further scrutiny.

PROSCRIBED TERRORIST ORGANISATIONS PROSCRIPTION CRITERIA Under the Terrorism Act 2000, the Home Secretary may proscribe an organisation if they believe it is concerned in terrorism. For the purposes of the Act, this means that it: commits or participates in acts of terrorism; prepares for terrorism; promotes or encourages terrorism (including the unlawful glorification of terrorism); or is otherwise concerned in terrorism. If the statutory test is met, there are other factors (first announced to Parliamentary during the passage of the Terrorism Act 2000) which the Secretary of State will take into account when deciding whether or not to exercise their discretion to proscribe. These criteria are: the nature and scale of an organisation's activities; the specific threat that it poses to the UK; the specific threat that it poses to British nationals overseas; the extent of the organisation's presence in the UK; and the need to support other members of the international community in the global fight against terrorism. LIST OF PROSCRIBED INTERNATIONAL TERRORIST GROUPS 48 international terrorist organisations are proscribed under the Terrorism Act 2000.
